            <h3>Education, Health, and Transport </h3>
            One of the many reasons why Dubai is the best city to live is because the government has heavily invested in the infrastructure. Dubai’s healthcare and education are of international standards and some of the best in the world. This is a good reason to live in Dubai alone or with your family. You get reliable healthcare, and your children go to the best schools. The good thing is there are numerous private schools to choose from, which offer the American or British Curriculum. 

            The healthcare system is also reliable, and you will get the best services. The staff is highly-trained and friendly. In private hospitals, you will find health workers from various nationalities who speak different languages. The transport system is clean, fast, and modern. This metro system is an excellent alternative to suing buses or taxis.

            <h3>Tax-Free</h3>
            One of the most attractive reasons to live in Dubai is that you don’t have to pay taxes. This means you will not only be paid better than other countries, but nothing will be deducted. You will have more money for your expenses and future. A tax-free salary allows you and your family to live a better life. The best thing about living in Dubai is that there is no VAT on food or goods; this means you will spend less. This is how most people afford a luxurious lifestyle in Dubai because there is extra money.

            <h3>Economy</h3>
            Dubai’s economy continues to grow, and the evidence is all around, from the infrastructure, innovation, hospitals, and even architecture. Dubai’s currency, the Emirati Dirham, remains stable and strong when compared to the Euro or the US Dollar. When this is put together with 5% annual GDP growth, makes the city’s economy unbeatable. Although this growth relies largely on the international workforce, Dubai companies/businesses pay their workers handsomely. This is one of the many reasons why people move to Dubai.
